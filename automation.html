<p>I’m currently transitioning into QA Automation and actively building my technical</p>
<p>skills in test automation, API testing, and modern QA tools. I have a strong</p>
<p>foundation in manual testing and am expanding into JavaScript-based automation,</p>
<p>CI/CD workflows, and test scripting. My goal is to combine analytical thinking with</p>
<p>technical expertise to deliver reliable, high-quality software. This journey reflects</p>
<p>my commitment to continuous learning and growth in the evolving QA field.</p>
